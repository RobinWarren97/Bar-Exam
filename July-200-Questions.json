  "feature" : " The state of Orrington wanted to prevent its only major league baseball team, the privately owned and operated Orrington Opossums, from moving to the rival state of Atrium. After a heated political debate in the legislature, Orrington enacted legislation providing for a one-time grant of $10 million in state funds to the Opossums to cover part of the projected income losses the team would suffer during the next five years if it remained in that state. The legislation required that the team remain in the state for at least ten years if it accepted the grant.  After accepting the grant, the owners of the Opossums decided to build a new $150 million stadium in Orrington. As plans for the construction of the new stadium proceeded, it became evident that all of the contractors and  subcontractors would be white males, and that  they had been chosen by the owners of the Opossums without any public bids because these contractors and subcontractors had  successfully built the only other new baseball stadium in the region. Several contractors who were females or members of minority racial groups filed suit against the owners of the Opossums in federal district court to compel public solicitation of bids for the construction of its new stadium on an equal opportunity basis, and to enjoin construction of the stadium until compliance was ensured. Their only claim was that the contracting practices of the owners of the Opossums denied them the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In this suit, the court will probably rule that  (A) the nexus between the actions of the  owners of the Opossums and the onetime grant of monies to them by the state is sufficiently substantial to subject their actions to the limitations of the  Fourteenth Amendment.

Despite the explanation that he was trying to revive Marilyn after she suddenly collapsed, Donald was charged with attempted rape and assault after a neighbor informed the police that she had heard Marilyn sobbing, “No, please no, let me alone.”  At trial, the forensic evidence was  inconclusive. The jury acquitted Donald of attempted rape but convicted him of assault. While he was serving his sentence for assault, Marilyn, who had never recovered from the coma, died. Donald was then indicted and  tried on a charge of felony murder. In this common-law jurisdiction, there is no statute that prevents a prosecutor from proceeding in this manner, but Donald argued that a second trial for felony murder after his original trial for attempted rape and assault would violate the double jeopardy clause.  His claim is  (D) incorrect, because he was convicted of  the assault charge.  ",

At the center, one of the young charges, Smith, often arrived with bruises and welts on his back and  legs. A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. Trelawney was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report Smith’s condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after Trelawney first noticed Smith’s condition, Smith was beaten  to death by his father. Trelawney has been charged with murder in the death of Smith. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to  the above, that the child had been the victim of  beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that Trelawney had seen. Smith’s mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of Smith’s father.  Trelawney’s best argument that he is NOT guilty of murder is  (D) the day-care corporation, rather than Trelawney, was guilty of the omission, which was sanctioned by its supervisorylevel agent.  ",

In desperation, he decided to set fire to his store to collect the  insurance. While looking through the basement for flammable material, he lit a  match to read the label on a can. The match  burned his finger and, in a reflex action, he dropped the match. It fell into a barrel and ignited some paper. Defendant made no effort to put out the fire but instead left the building. The fire spread and the store was destroyed by fire. Defendant was eventually arrested and indicted for arson.  Defendant is  (D) not guilty, because his starting the fire was the result of a reflex action and not a  voluntary act.  ",

The box containing the bottle stated in part: “CAUTION--Use only 1 capful at most once a day. Greater use may cause severe damage to the scalp.” Oscar read the writing on the box, removed the bottle, and threw the box away. Oscar’s roommate, Paul, asked to use the No-Flake, and Oscar said,  “Be careful not to use too much.” Paul thereafter  used No-Flake twice a day, applying two or three capfuls each time, notwithstanding the label statement that read: “Use no more than one capful per day.

After three  weeks of such use, Paul finally consulted a doctor who diagnosed his problem as a serious and irreversible case of dermatitis caused by excessive exposure to the active ingredients in No-Flake. These ingredients are uniquely effective at controlling dandruff, but there is no way to remove a remote risk to a small percentage of persons who may contract dermatitis as the result of applying for prolonged periods of time amounts of No-Flake substantially in excess of the directions.

Two years ago, Alice died and left Eastgate to her nephew, Paul, for life, with remainder to her godson, Richard, his heirs and assigns. Paul was 30 years old and Richard was 20 years old when Alice died. The devise of Eastgate was made subject to any mortgage on Eastgate in effect at the time of Alice’s death.  When Alice executed her will, the balance of  the mortgage debt on Eastgate was less than $5,000. A year before her death, Alice suffered financial reverses; and in order to meet her  debts, she had mortgaged Eastgate to secure a loan of $150,000. The entire principal of the mortgage remained outstanding when she died. As a result, the net annual income from  Eastgate was reduced not only by real estate taxes and regular maintenance costs, but also by the substantial mortgage interest payments that were due each month.  Paul was very dissatisfied with the limited benefit that he was receiving from the life estate. When, earlier this year, Acme, Inc., proposed to purchase Eastgate, demolish the building, pay off the mortgage, and construct a 30-story office building, Paul was willing to accept Acme’s offer. However, Richard adamantly refused the offer, even though Richard, as the remainderman, paid the principal portion of each monthly mortgage amortization payment. Richard was independently wealthy and wanted to convert Eastgate into a public park when he became entitled to possession.  When Acme realized that Richard would not  change his mind, Acme modified its proposal to a purchase of the life estate of Paul.

Paul’s life expectancy was 45 years.  When Richard learned that Paul had agreed to Acme’s modified proposal, Richard brought an appropriate action against them to enjoin their carrying it out.

  "feature" : " A statute of the state of Orrington provides that assessments of real property for tax purposes must represent the “actual value” of the property. The Blue County Tax Commission, in making its assessments, has uniformly and consistently determined the “actual value” of real property solely by reference to the price at which the particular property was last sold. In recent years, the market values of real property in Blue County have been rising at the rate of 15% per year.  Owner is required to pay real estate taxes on her home in Blue County that are 200% to 300% higher than those paid by many other owners of similar homes in similar  neighborhoods in that county, even though the current market values of their respective homes and Owner’s home are nearly identical. The reason the taxes on Owner’s home are  higher than those imposed on the other similar homes in similar neighborhoods is that she bought her home much more recently than the other owners and, therefore, it is assessed at a  much higher “actual value” than their homes. Persistent efforts by Owner to have her assessment reduced or the assessments of the  others raised by the Blue County Tax Commission have failed.  Owner has now filed suit against the Blue County Tax Commission, charging only that the tax assessment on her property is unconstitutional.  The strongest constitutional argument to support Owner’s claim is that the comparative overvaluation of Owner’s property by the Blue County Tax Commission in making tax assessments over time  (D) constitutes an ex post facto law.
