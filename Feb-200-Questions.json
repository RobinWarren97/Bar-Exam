The statute  contains an inseverable condition requiring  that any courthouse restored with the aid of  such a grant must be equipped with ramps and other facilities necessary to accommodate  physically handicapped people.  A law of the state of Blue requires public  buildings in Blue to have ramps and other facilities for handicapped people. It exempts  from those requirements any building that  is more than 70 years old if the State Board  of Architects finds that the installation of  such facilities would destroy the architectural  integrity of the building.  The Red County Courthouse in the state of Blue was built in 1895 and is still in use.  It does not contain ramps or other special  facilities for handicapped people. The State  Board of Architects has determined that the  installation of those facilities would destroy  the architectural integrity of the building.

The physician believes Plaintiff’s  worsened condition is permanent, and he can  find no basis for apportioning responsibility  for her present worsened condition between  the two automobile collisions.  Plaintiff brought an action for damages against  First and Second. At the close of Plaintiff’s  evidence, as outlined above, each of the  defendants moved for a directed verdict in his  favor on the ground that Plaintiff had failed  to produce evidence on which the jury could  determine how much damage each defendant  had caused. The jurisdiction adheres to the  common-law rules regarding joint and several  liability.  Plaintiff’s best argument in opposition to  the defendants’ motions would be that the  defendants are jointly and severally liable for  Plaintiff’s entire harm, because  (D) the defendants are joint tortfeasors who aggravated Plaintiff’s preexisting  condition.

A federal statute provides that all liability of  an interstate mover to a shipper for loss of  or damage to the shipper’s goods in transit is  governed exclusively by the contract between  them. The statute also requires the mover to  offer a shipper at least two contracts with  different levels of liability. In full compliance  with that federal statute, Mover offered Lee a  choice between two shipping agreements that  provided different levels of liability on the  part of Mover. The more expensive contract provided that Mover was fully liable in case  of loss or damage. The less expensive contract  limited Mover’s liability in case of loss or  damage to less than full value. Lee voluntarily  signed the less expensive contract with Mover,  fixing Mover’s liability at less than the full  value of the shipment.  Mover’s truck was involved in an accident in  the state of Pink. The accident was entirely a  product of the negligence of Mover’s driver.  Lee’s household goods were totally destroyed.  In accordance with the contract, Mover  reimbursed Lee for less than the full value  of the goods. Lee then brought suit against  Mover under the tort law of the state of Pink  claiming that he was entitled to be reimbursed  for the full value of the goods. Mover filed a  motion to dismiss.  In this suit, the court should  (D) deny the motion to dismiss, because it is  unconstitutional for a federal statute to  authorize Mover to contract out of any  degree of liability for its own negligence.

The faculty member did not appeal the  decision of the state administrative board to  the Illitron state courts. Instead, she sought  a declaratory judgment in federal district  court to the effect that the state statute  prescribing the procedures for her dismissal is  unconstitutional.  In this case, the federal district court should  (C) hold the statute unconstitutional, because  a state may not ordinarily deprive an  employee of a property interest in  a job without giving the employee  an opportunity for some kind of a  predismissal hearing to respond to the  charges against that employee.

  "feature" : " A statute of the state of Illitron declares  that after five years of continuous service in  their positions all state employees, including  faculty members at the state university, are  entitled to retain their positions during “good  behavior.” The statute also contains a number  of procedural provisions. Any state employee  who is dismissed after that five-year period  must be given reasons for the dismissal before it takes effect. In addition, such an employee  must, upon request, be granted a postdismissal hearing before an administrative board to seek reinstatement and back pay.  The statute precludes any other hearing or  opportunity to respond to the charges. That  post-dismissal hearing must occur within six  months after the dismissal takes effect. The  burden of proof at such a hearing is on the  state, and the board may uphold the dismissal  only if it is supported by a preponderance of  the evidence. An employee who is dissatisfied  with a decision of the board after a hearing  may appeal its decision to the state courts. The  provisions of this statute are inseverable.  A teacher who had been employed  continuously for seven years as a faculty  member at the state university was dismissed.  A week before the dismissal took effect, she  was informed that she was being dismissed  because of a charge that she accepted a  bribe from a student in return for raising the student’s final grade in her course. At that time she requested an immediate hearing to  contest the propriety of her dismissal.  Three months after her dismissal, she  was granted a hearing before the state  administrative board. The board upheld her  dismissal, finding that the charge against her  was supported by a preponderance of the  evidence presented at the hearing.  The faculty member did not appeal the  decision of the state administrative board to  the Illitron state courts. Instead, she sought  a declaratory judgment in federal district  court to the effect that the state statute  prescribing the procedures for her dismissal is  unconstitutional.  In this case, the federal district court should  (D) hold the statute constitutional, because  the due process clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment entitles state employees who  have a right to their jobs during good  behavior only to a statement of reasons  for their dismissal and an opportunity for  a post-dismissal hearing.

On May 4, Mater and Nirvana Motors both signed a single document evidencing  a contract for the sale by Nirvana to Mater,  “as a wedding gift for Mater’s son Dilbert,” a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, under the same terms as previously stated in their  correspondence. On May 5, Mater handed  Dilbert a carbon copy of this document. In  reliance on the prospective gift, Dilbert on  May 20 sold his nearly new Cheetah (an  expensive sports car) to a dealer at a “bargain”  price of $50,000 and immediately informed  Mater and Nirvana that he had done so.  On May 25, however, Mater and Nirvana Motors by mutual agreement rescinded in  a signed writing “any and all agreements  heretofore made between the undersigned  parties for the sale-and-purchase of a new  Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan.” Later that  day, Nirvana sold for $190,000 cash to another buyer the only new Mark XX Rolls-Royce that it had in stock or could  readily obtain elsewhere. On June 1, Dilbert  tendered $180,000 in cash to Nirvana Motors  and demanded delivery to him “within a  reasonable time” of a new Mark XX RollsRoyce sedan with all available equipment.  Nirvana rejected the tender and denied any  obligation.  If Dilbert sues Nirvana for breach of contract,  which of the following will the court probably decide?  (C) Nirvana wins, because Dilbert, if an  intended beneficiary at all of the MaterNirvana contract, was only a donee  beneficiary.",
