The plant is located in a sparsely settled rural area,  remote from the large city served by Utility. Farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had  farmed the land for 40 years and had lived on the  premises. The prevailing winds carry fumes from the  new plant over Farmer’s land. His 1976 crop was less  than half the average size of this crop over the five  years immediately preceding the construction of the  plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the  crop reduction. Farmer’s hay fever, from which he had long suffered,  became worse in 1976. Physicians advised him that  the lignite fumes were affecting it and that serious  lung disease would soon result unless he moved  away from the plant. He did so, selling his farm at its  reasonable market value, which was then $10,000 less  than before the construction of the plant.  If Farmer asserts a claim based on negligence  against Utility for crop damages, will Farmer  prevail? (D) Yes, because operation of the plant  constitutes a nuisance.   Questions 71-76    On March 1, Computer Programs, Inc. (CP) orally  agreed with Holiday Department Store (HDS) to  write a set of programs for HDS’s computer and to  coordinate the programs with HDS’s billing methods.  A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided  in its entirety: HDS will pay CP $20,000 in two equal  installments within one month of completion if  CP is successful in shortening by one-half the  processing time for the financial transactions  now handled on HDS’s Zenon 747 computer;  CP to complete by July 1. This agreement may  be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6, CP demanded $10,000, saying the job  was one-half done. After HDS denied liability, the  parties orally agreed that HDS should deposit $20,000  in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction  of HDS’s computer systems manager. The escrow  deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, CP completed  the programs, having used an amount of time in which  it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that  time to other jobs. Tests by CP and HDS’s computer  systems manager then showed that the computer  programs, not being perfectly coordinated with HDS’s  billing methods, cut processing time by only 47  percent. They would, however, save HDS $12,000 a  year. Further, if HDS would spend $5,000 to change  its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by  CP, the programs would cut processing time by a total  of 58 percent, saving HDS another $8,000 a year.  HDS’s computer systems manager refused in good  faith to certify satisfactory completion. HDS asked the  escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that  nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued  to use the programs. ",

Ben filed suit in an appropriate court  alleging that the state statute barring an illegitimate  child from sharing in a parent’s estate is invalid, and  that he should be declared lawful heir to his father’s  estate.   The state’s strongest defense of the statute would  be that (D) its interest in promoting family life and in  encouraging the formal acknowledgment  of paternity gives the law a rational basis.   ",

Doe repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and  making faces, that “the g–ddamned milk packaging  law is stupid,” and that “I will strangle every one of  those g–ddamned legislators I can get hold of because  this law they created proves they are all too dumb to  live.” After about 15 minutes, Doe stopped speaking,  and the amused crowd dispersed.

The first statute prohibits “all speech making,  picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the  Capitol steps in front of the main entryway during the  hours of 7:45 a.m.–8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m.–12:15 p.m.,  12:45 p.m.–l:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m.–5:15 p.m. on  Capitol working days.” ",

He obtained  governmental approval (as required by applicable  ordinances) and, between 1968 and 1970, he sold  140 of the lots, inserting in each of the 140 deeds the  following provision: “The Grantee, for himself and his heirs, assigns  and successors, covenants and agrees that the  premises conveyed herein shall have erected  thereon one single-family dwelling and that no  other structure (other than a detached garage,  normally incident to a single-family dwelling)  shall be erected or maintained; and, further, that  no use shall ever be made or permitted to be  made other than occupancy by a single family  for residential purposes only.” Because of difficulty encountered in selling the  remaining lots for single-family use, in January 1971,  Oscar advertised the remaining lots with prominent  emphasis: “These lots are not subject to any restriction  and purchasers will find them adaptable to a wide  range of uses.”   Suppose that Oscar sold 50 lots during 1971  without inserting in the deeds any provisions  relating to structures or uses. Doyle purchased  one of the 50 lots and proposes to erect a service  station and to conduct a retail business for the  sale of gasoline, etc. Pringle purchased a lot  from Boyer. Boyer had purchased from Oscar  in 1968 and the deed had the provision that is  quoted in the fact situation. Pringle brings suit to  prevent Doyle from erecting the service station  and from conducting a retail business. In the  litigation between Pringle and Doyle, which of  the following constitutes the best defense for  Doyle? (D) The facts do not establish a common  building or development scheme for the  entire subdivision.   ",

Driver received personal injuries, and Visitor’s car  was damaged severely as a result of the impact. Statutes of State Y make it a misdemeanor (1) to  park a motor vehicle so that any part projects into  a crosswalk and (2) to enter an intersection contrary  to a traffic signal.   If Driver asserts a claim against City, the theory  on which he has the best chance of prevailing is  that City (D) created a dangerous trap by not promptly  replacing the broken pole.

Victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt  whether he could promptly get necessary medical  treatment. Accordingly, First wrote into their contract  his promise to Victim “to pay from any settlement  with Driver compensation to any physician who  provides professional services for Victim’s injuries.”  The contract also provided that First’s duties were  “nonassignable.” First immediately filed suit against  Driver. Victim then sought and received medical  treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from Doctor,  but failed to inform Doctor of First’s promise. After receiving a bill from Doctor for $1,000, Victim  immediately wrote Doctor explaining that he was  unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract  with First. Victim then asked First about payment of this bill,  but First requested a release from their employment  contract, stating that he would like to refer Victim’s  claim to attorney Second and that Second was willing  to represent Victim in the pending lawsuit. Victim  wrote a letter to First releasing him from their contract  and agreeing to Second’s representation. A copy of  this letter was sent to Doctor.

Mammoth’s counsel seeks to have Sheriff testify  that while he was investigating the accident he  was told by Pemberton, “This was probably  our fault.” The judge should rule the proffered  evidence (D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not  within any exception.

Assuming that Sawtooth committed a total  breach on March 1, 1972, and assuming further  that he was aware when the agreement was  made of the purpose for which Farquart wanted  the completed house, which of the following,  if true, would best support Farquart’s claim  for consequential damages on account of delay  beyond June 10, 1972, in getting the house  finished? (D) On June 10, 1972, Farquart paid a $5,000  judgment obtained against him in a suit  filed March 15, 1972, by an adjoining  landowner on account of Farquart’s  negligent excavation, including blasting, in  an attempt to finish the house himself after  Sawtooth’s repudiation.

In that year he executed  and delivered to Price a quitclaim deed which  purported to release and quitclaim to Price  all of the right, title, and interest of Owen in  Blackacre. Price accepted the quitclaim and  placed the deed in his safe deposit box. Owen was indebted to Crider in the amount of  $35,000. In September 1971, Owen executed and  delivered to Crider a warranty deed, purporting  to convey the fee simple to Blackacre, in  exchange for a full release of the debt he owed  to Crider. Crider immediately recorded his deed. In December 1971, Price caused his quitclaim  deed to Blackacre to be recorded and notified  Crider that he (Price) claimed title.

All competing papers must  be submitted to the Dean’s office before  May 1. (The National Competition was conducted by an  outside agency unconnected with any law school.)  Student read this notice on November 2, and  thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on  obscenity law, which he had started in October, a  winner. Student also left on a counter in the Dean’s  office a signed note saying, “I accept the faculty’s  $500 Obscenity Competition offer.” This note was  inadvertently placed in Student’s file and never  reached the Dean or any faculty member personally.  On the following April 1, the above notice was  removed and the following substituted therefor: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding  the National Obscenity Law Competition  must be withdrawn. Student’s paper was submitted through the Dean’s  office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that  Student had won the National Obscenity Law  Competition and the prize of $1,000.

Questions 331-332    In 1945, Owen, owner of both Blackacre and  Whiteacre, executed and delivered two separate  deeds by which he conveyed the two tracts of land  as follows: Blackacre was conveyed “To Alpha  and his heirs as long as it is used exclusively for  residential purposes, but if it is ever used for other  than residential purposes, to the American Red Cross.”  Whiteacre was conveyed “To Beta and her heirs as  long as it is used exclusively for residential purposes,  but if it is used for other than residential purposes  prior to 1965, then to the Salvation Army.” In 1950,  Owen died leaving a valid will by which he devised  all his real estate to his brother, Bill. The will had no  residuary clause. Owen was survived by Bill and by  Owen’s daughter, Delia, who was Owen’s sole heir. For the purpose of this set of questions, it may be  assumed that the common law rule against perpetuities  applies in the state where the land is located and that  the state also has a statute providing that “all future  estates and interests are alienable, descendible, and  devisable in the same manner as possessory estates  and interests.” ",

If Brown interposes an insanity defense and  the jurisdiction in which he is tried has adopted  only the M’Naghten test of insanity, then the  strongest argument for the defense under that  test is that (D) Brown’s acts were the product of a mental  disease.

Questions 344-345   Ogden was the fee simple owner of three adjoining  vacant lots fronting on a common street in a primarily  residential section of a city which had no zoning  laws. The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3.  Ogden conveyed Lot 1 to Akers and Lot 2 to Bell.  Ogden retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres  of woodland. Bell, whose lot was between the other  two, built a house on his lot. Bell’s house included a  large window on the side facing Lot 3. The window  provided a beautiful view from Bell’s living room,  thereby adding value to Bell’s house. Akers erected a house on his lot. Ogden made no  complaint to either Akers or Bell concerning the  houses they built. After both Akers and Bell had  completed their houses, the two of them agreed to  and did build a common driveway running from the  street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway  was built on the line between the two houses so that  one-half of the way was located on each lot. Akers  and Bell exchanged right-of-way deeds by which each  of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns,  an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds  were properly recorded. After Akers and Bell had  lived in their respective houses for 30 years, a new  public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots  1, 2, and 3. Akers informed Bell that, since the new  street removed the need for their common driveway,  he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore,  he intended to discontinue its use and expected Bell to  do the same. At about the same time, Ogden began the  erection of a six-story apartment house on Lot 3. If the  apartment house is completed, it will block the view  from Bell’s window and will substantially reduce the  value of Bell’s lot. ",

Andrews agreed to pay part of the rent  to Lane, who did not object to this arrangement,  despite a provision in the lease that provided that  “any assignment, subletting, or transfer of any  rights under this lease without the express written consent of the landlord is strictly prohibited, null, and void.” Talbot objected to Andrews’s moving  in, even if Andrews were to pay a part of the rent. When Andrews moved in, Talbot brought an  appropriate action against Lane, Rogers, and  Andrews for a declaratory judgment that Rogers  had no right to assign. Rogers’ defense was that  he and Talbot were tenants in common of a term  for years, and that he, Rogers, had a right to  assign a fractional interest in his undivided onehalf interest. In this action, Talbot will (D) not prevail, because his claim amounts to a  void restraint on alienation. ",

Esther’s uncle, Miller, who  was present on this occasion, read the memorandum  and thereupon said to Esther, “and if he doesn’t pay  your expenses, I will.” Gray paid her tuition, room,  and board for her first year but died just before the  end of that year. Subsequently, Esther learned that  she had received two “A’s” in the second semester.

The earthen dam trapped water that Hull used to water  a herd of cattle he owned. After 12 years of possession of Brownacre, Hull gave possession of Brownacre to  Burns. At the same time, Hull also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to  Burns by a document that was sufficient as a bill of  sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient  as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, Burns entered into a lease with Orris to  lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the  end of the five-year term of the lease, Burns remained  on Brownacre for an additional three years and then  left Brownacre. At that time Orris conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to Powell. The period of time to  acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction  is 10 years. ",

The strongest argument for admission of Pullen’s  testimony concerning the telephone call is that (D) self-identification is sufficient  authentication of a telephone call. ",

While Dooley was  throwing warm-up pitches on the sidelines during a  game, he was continuously heckled by some spectators  seated in the stands above the dugout behind a wire mesh fence. On several occasions, Dooley turned and  looked directly at the hecklers with a scowl on his  face, but the heckling continued.

The trial court directed a verdict for the  defendants on the battery count. The jury found for the  defendants on the negligence count because the jury  determined that Dooley could not foresee that the ball  would pass through the wire mesh fence. Patricia has appealed the judgments on the battery  counts, contending that the trial court erred in  directing verdicts for Dooley and the City Robins.   On appeal, the judgment entered on the directed  verdict in Dooley’s favor on the battery claim  should be (C) reversed and the case remanded, if a jury  could find on the evidence that Dooley  intended to cause the hecklers to fear being  hit.",
